One of the most frustrating things when doing Android development on hardware devices is when you plug in a new device, and it isn't recognised by adb. Usually you see this:<br /><br /><pre>[dmdrummond@fiva ~]$ adb devices<br />List of devices attached <br />emulator-5554 device<br />???????????? no permissions<br /></pre><pre><br /></pre>The normal cause of this is not having a udev entry for the manufacturer of the device you just plugged in.  On &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://d.android.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the Android Developers site</a>&nbsp;there is a&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">guide</a>&nbsp;to setting these up, and a table containing a number of codes for different device manufacturers. I have compiled this list into a rules file for udev to remove this annoyance from my life, and yours too.<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/dmdrummond/51-android.rules" target="_blank">https://github.com/dmdrummond/51-android.rules</a><br /><br />Please add any additions, or any corrections to the comments below, and I will keep the file up to date, alternatively add through github.
